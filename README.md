# Hi there, I'm Dejan 👋

🎯 I'm a junior front-end developer currently learning **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Git**.  
🚀 My goal is to become a full-stack web developer and build clean, modern, and responsive websites.  
🌱 I’m currently focusing on mastering the basics before moving on to more advanced technologies like **JavaScript**, **React**, **Node.js**, and **Databases**.

---

## 📌 What I'm focusing on right now:
- ✅ HTML5 & Semantic Markup
- 🎨 CSS3 & Layout (Flexbox, Grid)
- 🧠 Git & GitHub version control

---

## 🛣️ Technologies I'm planning to learn next:
- 🔷 SCSS (Sass preprocessor)
- ⚙️ JavaScript (DOM, ES6+)
- ⚛️ React & Redux (Component-based development)
- 🧩 Node.js & Express (Backend development)
- 🗄️ MongoDB / PostgreSQL (Databases)
- 📡 REST APIs & JSON

---

## 🚀 My Learning Journey
I believe in **learning by doing**, so I will regularly upload:
- 💻 Practice exercises
- 🧪 Mini projects
- 📁 Full projects as I progress

All code will be organized in repositories and updated as I improve my skills.
